# swift
A simple repo that will contribute as a blog of my learning steps towards swift development

My coding languege experience:
-  HTML
-  CSS
-  JS
-  Python (very basic)

My goal is to get to a point that i can make a good working app in swift for the IOS store. i will start learning basics back end swift for now because i sadly dont have acces to Xcode yet. im working with a windows 11 and a virtual machine will take to much power of my cpu. that means that im gonna be working on a Online Swift Playground for now.

In the making of a new code i made the realisation that the link above uses a read only terminal. that means i couldnt input anything in the terminal, therefore really limiting the amount of the already limited amount of swift i could do.

Luckily i found a good swift coding compiler that allowed me to input things into the terminal.

The reason im going to pick up Swift is for "my" company Edulock. where i will be responsible for the Ios version of the app.
